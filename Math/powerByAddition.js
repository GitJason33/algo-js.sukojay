// goal is to find the power of a base, but multiplication is restricted
// difficulty: easy +

/*
to solve, reminder of multiplication: 
base is the number multiplied by itself
exponent is the times this base is multiplied by itself

base^exponent = result

base*base*base*... } exponent times
example: 2^4 = 2*2*2*2 } 4 times

while multiplication is restricted, we have to figure out a second way
see: 
x*y is x+x+x+... } y times
example: 3*5 = 3+3+3+3+3 } 5 times ... analogical enough right?

now to say right, let's get back to base
example: 2^4: 2*2*2*2 } 4 times
let's add up: 
2*2 = 2+2 = 4. base+base+... } base times, huh? the problem is divided here, remember that!
4*2 = 4+4 = 8.
8*2 = 8+8 = 16.
and we finish. but wait, that's not exponent times, that's 'exponent-1' times!

and we can see that each time we finish an addition, we take the result and use
it as a new base each time. we call it a 'term' in an expression. here updating.
